<description>Kevin followed Alan Shearer on the trail from Blackburn Rovers to Gallowgate. His unselfish running often created space for his fellow forwards. Kevin's grandfather, father and brother all played for professional clubs in Scotland. 
Has represented Scotland at virtually every possible level and has a half century of full caps to his credit. Kevin had a delayed start last season due to a thigh injury and it was not until September that he made his first appearance for Newcastle, coming off the subs' bench to score against his old club Coventry.  However after a handful more appearances he succumbed to a series of injuries which disrupted his campaign: a torn right hamstring was followed in turn by injuries to each of his calves leading to three months on the sidelines. He eventually returned to the Magpies' squad in January but it was not until the last few games that he reappeared in the starting line-up. Although now in the later stages of his career he remains as lively and hardworking as ever, and can always be relied upon to give his all for the team, whether it be as an out-and-out striker or playing just behind the front line. His 50th cap for Scotland came in the World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October and he was honoured with the captaincy of the side to mark the occasion, while a few days later he scored the goal that earned a vital point for his country in Croatia.  Kevin comes from a footballing family as his grandfather, father and brother all played the game professionally in Scotland. 
 Kevin joined Huddersfield Town in August 2002 on a week-to-week contract but was released two months later.</description>

<description>Javier had spent his entire career at Real Sociedad emerging from the youth system to play for the first team midway through the 1993-94 season. He has been a permanent fixture in the team when fit as the central midfielder or as a striker and he made his international debut in October 1998 against Israel. He  has only been on the fringes of the international scene ever since. 
 Unexpectedly called up for Japan and South Korea World Cup after not appearing in qualification, and he was surprise choice for Spain's first game in the finals against Slovenia. 
 Javier joined Blackburn Rovers in July 2004 on a two-year contract.</description>

<description>A versatile player, who can play as left back, left midfield or in the centre he has never really established himself as his nations first choice. He began his club career at Karabukspor before signing for Galatasaray in 1994. His performances earned him an international debut in August 1996 and he was a member of the 2000 European Championship Finals squad after returning from a serious injury. At club level Galatasaray dropped him in 2001 after refusing to sign a new contract and Premiership side Blackburn Rovers snapped him up in March 2002. He was a regular in qualification and will challenge Abdullah Ercan for the left hand side position. 
 Along with Alpay, Hakan was the second Turkish player to be sent-off in their World Cup finals opener against Brazil. He was dismissed for two yellow cards - the second following Rivaldo's over-reaction so becoming the 100th player to be sent-off in the history of the World Cup finals. Otherwise he enjoyed a superb tournament and was selected for FIFA's All-Star squad.</description>

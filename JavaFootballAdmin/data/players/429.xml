<description>David started the 2000-01 campaign a little uncertainly in the centre of the Shrewsbury Town defence but quickly found his feet and went on to produce some excellent form in the first half of the season. He moved on to Cardiff in February for a substantial fee as the Bluebirds sought to firm up their defence in the run-in to their promotion challenge. He took time to settle in at Ninian Park but by the end of the season had begun to do an effective job in sealing up the back line. David is a tall commanding central defender with a powerful long throw. 
 David was forced to retire through injury in April 2003.</description>
